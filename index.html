    This is a cenerted heading

<p style='font-family:Verdana;'>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines (in verdana)
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
It doesn't ignore this horizontal rule
<hr>
however. Nor this line break
<br>

Good stuff!
</p>


<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:150%;">
This is anotehr paragraph but in a different font 
<br>
It is also in a different size
</p>




<pre>
This is some preformatted text 

The line breaks are just from me typing them
