<h1 style='font-size:60px;'> Website homepage </h1>

<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
It doesn't ignore this horizontal rule
<hr>
however. Nor this line break
<br>

Good stuff!
</p>

<pre>
This is some preformatted text 

The line breaks are just from me typing them
